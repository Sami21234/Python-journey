
# 9. Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S? 
# s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]} 

s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]} 
print(s)

# we cannot change the list inside in the set
# Bacause, first of all we cannot insert the list in the Sets and sets are immutable, we cannot changed them 

# If we want still to change the answer than we can use the  tuple instead of list
